# 📊 Data Science Internship @ Celebal Technologies

This repository contains the work I completed during my Data Science internship at **Celebal Technologies** in Summer 2025. The internship focused on applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to solve real-world problems using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and other key tools in the data science ecosystem.

## 🧠 Project Title

**Customer Churn Prediction**  
(Applies if your project was churn-related — otherwise replace with your actual project)

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack & Tools

- Python (NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, seaborn)
- scikit-learn (model building, hyperparameter tuning)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git/GitHub
- VS Code / Google Colab
- Excel (for initial EDA)

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Dataset used: `file.csv` (Titanic dataset or Churn dataset depending on your project)
- Source: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) or provided by Celebal

## 🔄 Project Workflow

1. **Data Exploration & Cleaning**
   - Identified missing values
   - Performed imputation and encoding
   - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Converted categorical variables using `pd.get_dummies()`
   - Scaled features using `StandardScaler`

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Trained multiple ML models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - SVM
     - Naive Bayes
   - Evaluated using:
     - Accuracy
     - Precision
     - Recall
     - F1-Score
     - Classification Report

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Used `RandomizedSearchCV` and `GridSearchCV` to optimize model performance

5. **Model Deployment (optional)**
   - Best model saved using `joblib` for future integration

---

## ✅ Results

- Best performing model: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Accuracy: `XX%` (replace with your actual results)
- F1-Score: `YY%`
- Final model saved as `best_model.pkl`

## 💡 Key Learnings

- How to clean and preprocess real-world datasets
- Differences between classification models
- Importance of model evaluation beyond accuracy
- Applying hyperparameter tuning to improve performance
- Real-world problem solving using machine learning
